Why It's Useful

The app simplifies data handling with a user-friendly interface. It organizes data better, reduces manual handling, and offers secure and validated storage with a structured database.

Planned Features

- User authentication through **bcrypt.js**
- Token-based session handling using **JWT**
- Environment variable handling with **dotenv**
- Form validation through **express-validator**

 Styling Approach

I’m using **Bootstrap** for layout and responsiveness, combined with **custom CSS** to match the look and feel of the app’s purpose.

Languages used  during development:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- EJS
- Bootstrap & CSS

P.S: The reason I have less commits in this is beacause this is not the initial repository i created for the project, the earlier one got ruined so i had to make a new one.
